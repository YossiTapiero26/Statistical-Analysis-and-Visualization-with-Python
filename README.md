# Statistical-Analysis-and-Visualization-with-Python

Perform statistical analysis and data visualization using Python. I will generate a synthetic dataset, perform descriptive and inferential statistics, and visualize the results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

# Project Overview
I will generate a synthetic dataset and use it to perform various statistical analyses. My final submission will include a presentation highlighting my findings, visualizations, and interpretations.

# Deliverables
A presentation summarizing my findings, visualizations, and interpretations.
I will ensure my presentation addresses the technical questions provided.
Tools and Libraries

I will use the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
  
# Tasks and Guidelines
**Task 1: Data Generation**

I will generate a synthetic dataset using Numpy to create a dataset with 1000 samples.

The dataset will include the following columns: Age, Height, Weight, Gender, and Income.

- Age: Normally distributed with a mean of 35 and a standard deviation of 10.
- Height: Normally distributed with a mean of 170 cm and a standard deviation of 15 cm.
- Weight: Normally distributed with a mean of 70 kg and a standard deviation of 10 kg.
- Gender: Randomly assigned with 50% probability for 'Male' and 'Female'.
- Income: Normally distributed with a mean of 50,000 and a standard deviation of 15,000.
  
**Task 2: Descriptive Statistics**

I will calculate basic descriptive statistics:
I will calculate mean, median, standard deviation, and variance for Age, Height, Weight, and Income.
I will calculate the mode for Gender.

**Task 3: Data Visualization**

I will visualize the distributions:
I will plot histograms for Age, Height, Weight, and Income.
I will use Seaborn to create KDE plots for Age, Height, Weight, and Income.
I will create boxplots to identify outliers:
I will create boxplots for Age, Height, Weight, and Income.

**Task 4: Correlation Analysis**

I will calculate correlation:
I will calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between Age, Height, Weight, and Income.
I will visualize the correlation matrix:
I will use a heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix.

**Task 5: Inferential Statistics**

I will perform hypothesis testing:
I will perform a t-test to see if there is a significant difference in Income between Male and Female.
Technical Questions

I will ensure my presentation addresses the following questions:

1. How did I generate the synthetic dataset, and why did I choose normal distributions for the variables?
2. What insights can I draw from the descriptive statistics calculated for Age, Height, Weight, and Income?
3. What do the KDE plots and histograms tell me about the distribution of the data?
4. How can I interpret the boxplots, and what do they reveal about potential outliers in the dataset?
5. I will discuss the significance of the correlation matrix and what relationships I can infer from it.
6. I will explain the results of the t-test. What does the p-value indicate about the difference in Income between Male and Female?
